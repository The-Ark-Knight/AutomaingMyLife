## Getting Started

To get started with the GitHub Repository Setup script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-repo-setup.git
   ```

2. **Install GitHub CLI:**
   Ensure you have GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated on your system. You can download it from the official GitHub CLI repository.

## Usage

Creating and configuring your GitHub repository is a breeze with the GitHub Repository Setup script:

1. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script in your PowerShell 7 terminal.

   ```powershell
   ./github-repo-setup.ps1
   ```

2. **Enter Repository Name:**
   You will be prompted to enter the name of your GitHub repository.

3. **Local Repository Creation:**
   The script checks if the local repository already exists. If not, it creates a local folder for your repository and initializes a Git repository in it.

4. **Create README:**
   A README file with the repository name as a level 1 heading is generated in the local folder.

5. **GitHub Repository Setup:**
   Using GitHub CLI, the script creates a remote repository on GitHub with the specified name.

6. **Configure Remote Origin:**
   The script sets up the remote origin in your local repository, allowing you to push changes to the remote.

7. **Initial Commit and Push:**
   The script adds and commits all local files, creates the 'main' branch, and pushes the initial commit to the GitHub repository.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, such as authentication errors or problems with your GitHub access token, ensure that your GitHub CLI is correctly configured and authenticated. You can also double-check your access token's permissions.

## Future Works

### Improved Repository Customization

In future updates, we plan to enhance repository customization. Users will be able to choose specific configurations for their repositories, such as private or public settings.

### Cross-Platform Support

We are working on making the script compatible with multiple operating systems, ensuring a seamless experience whether you're on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

### Enhanced Logging and Notifications

Expect additional options for more advanced configuration, such as specifying the README content or including additional files.

### Collaboration and Contribution

We encourage collaboration and contributions to make the GitHub Repository Setup script even more versatile and user-friendly. Feel free to create a pull request or open an issue in the repository. Together, we'll continue simplifying the process of setting up GitHub repositories for your projects! üöÄüë©‚Äçüíªüì¶
