# YouTube Video Downloader

The YouTube Video Downloader is a Python script that allows you to download YouTube videos by providing the video's URL. It utilizes the `pytube` library to fetch and download the video with the highest resolution available.

## Getting Started

To get started with the YouTube Video Downloader, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/The-Ark-Knight/AutomatingMyLife.git
    ```

2. Install the required library, `pytube`. You can install it using `pip`:

## Usage

1. Run the script in the terminal or command prompt.

    ```
    python AutomatingMyLife/PythonScripts/ytDownloader.py
    ```

2. You will be prompted to enter the YouTube URL of the video you want to download.

3. The script will retrieve information about the video, such as its title and view count.

4. It will then download the video with the highest available resolution to the current directory.

5. You will receive a "Download complete" message once the download is finished.

## Future Works

### 1. User-Friendly Options

Enhance the script by adding options for the user to choose the download location and video resolution. This would provide more flexibility and customization to users.

### 2. Error Handling

Implement better error handling and informative messages to help users understand and resolve issues that may arise during the download process.

### 3. Download Playlists

Extend the script's functionality to download entire YouTube playlists, not just individual videos.

### 4. Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Consider creating a graphical user interface for the script, making it more accessible to users who may not be comfortable with the command line.

### 5. Continuous Updates

Stay up to date with the `pytube` library and regularly update your script to accommodate changes or new features introduced in the library.
